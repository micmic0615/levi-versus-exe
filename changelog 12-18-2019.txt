changelog - december 18, 2019

--- General
------ A Full potion now always spawns at the end of every arena
------ Quarks are now stored after popping a pinyata, they will all spawn at the end of each arena
------ Disabled portals when there are active quarks/full potions in the map
------ Reduced heal cast point by around 30%.  Adjusted the heal amount from 75% -> 65%
------ Equipping skills on used skill slots will now automatically drop the overwritten skill (old skill used to just be overwritten, effectively erasing them from the game)

--- Added Skill level/upgrade system
------ Skills can now be upgraded by stacking duplicate copies
------ Skills levels increase damage/flinch output by 15%
------ Skills level will always only increase by one per upgrade, regardless of the levels of the 2 items that are stacked

--- Overhauled the  shop system
------ Shops now allow you to choose what to buy from a pool of 3 semi-randomly determined skills
------ Shops allow you to purchase a restock, resetting their inventory but also inflating their prices
------ Shop prices scale with the player's level
------ Upgrade Level of the the skills sold scale on the arena level

--- Tweaked the arena rewards
------ Removed the Full and Half Potion rewards
------ Added a free blessing - "Recovery".  This automatically restores your Shield and Vitality the first time you stagger
------ Added an expensive permanent blessing (this bonus is lost upon death unlike the Tachyon upgrade) that increases your flask charges by one
------ Adjusted the prices across the board and also did some tweaks on the bonus values
------ Treasure rewards (one free weapon/spell) will now always spawn a skill that is one upgrade level higher than what the shops sell

--- Various weapon rebalances
------ Slash now does a 3-hit combo (finishing attack does double damage but also puts the skill in a short cooldown, resulting in more or less the same DPS)
------ Various tweaks to some weapon damage/flinch values

--- Adjusted enemy spawn data across all stages
