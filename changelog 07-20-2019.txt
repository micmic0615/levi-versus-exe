- World Tweaks
--- Gold system implemented
------ Gold can be used to buy healing/potion charges and weapons/stats
------ Gold is gained by killing enemies
------ All gold is lost upon death

--- Arenas and Sanctuaries
------ Arenas are now short rooms of 3-4 waves only
------ Finishing an arena spawns 2 portals, one leads to the next arena, the other leads to a sanctuary
------ Sanctuaries are safe rooms with shops where you can spend your gold
------ Skipping the sanctuary makes you get 25% more gold on the next arena
------ Arenas now have gift boxes with various challenges.  Doing the challenge will spawn a random weapon after the wave is cleared

--- Added placeholder background sprites for ease of asset swap in the future (since parallax coding is done)

=====================================

- Combat Tweaks

--- Streamlined debuff effects to Disarm, Shock, Frost, Dazed & Impact (more debuffs to come)
------ Disarm prevents enemies from attacking
------ Shock slows both movespeed and attack speed (caused by lightning based attacks)
------ Frosted slightly slows movespeed and attackspeed and also makes the affected target take more damage (caused by ice based attacks)
------ Impact greatly slows movespeed and deals bonus damage when the enemy hits a wall (normally caused by attacks that push enemies) 
------ Dazed prevents the target from doing anything similar to stagger 

--- Afflicting the same enemy with the same debuff repeatedly reduces its effectiveness (in terms of duration) until it is resisted completely

--- Added healing 
------ 3 charges that heal 75% health per pop
------ Refilled by the shop in Sanctuaries that sell healing

--- Added tiles

--- Temporarily disabled Pinyatas

--- Adjusted camera to make it have a constant zoom (camera used to show the entire room so zoom is dependent on room size)

--- You can now swap up your weapon slots by dragging them to each other in the HUD
