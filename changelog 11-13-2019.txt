changelog - november 13, 2019

--- Reworked Frenzy
------ Instead of triggering Frenzy (+100% atk speed bonus) for 1.5 seconds on kill and 0.5 seconds whenever hitting a staggered enemy, Frenzy is now triggered for 3 seconds whenever getting a tachyon.

--- Adjusted Beatdown damage to scale from both Vit and Shield damage
------ It used to scale 100% from vit damage, now it scales 80% from vit damage and 20% from shield damage

--- A variation of Beatdown now triggers whenever the player uses a spell (any skill that costs mana)
------ This beatdown automatically selects all currently staggered enemies and fires a cluster of bullets to them
------ The damage of these bullets scale 20% from vit damage and 80% from shield damage
------ This new mechanic, along with the adjustments to frenzy, are attempts to make Electron builds viable

--- Tweaked how parry damage is computed
------ Before, the Vit Damage of the parry will use your vit Damage while the parry's shield damage uses your shield damage
------ Now, the parry damage uses your higher attack stat and scales both the vit and shield damage from that higher attack stat.
------ This essentially rewards players who invest most of their level-up bonuses in just a single offense stat (high damage, low defense build)

--- Adjustments on weapon/spell damages and attribute scalings
--- Adjustments on enemy scaling

--- New Boss: Scarlet Shadow, Nul (uses megaman zero sprite)
------ This boss is located in the last (8th) stage and is level 25.
------ Available in demo/sandbox mode as a level 1 enemy.
------ this boss has 3 phases
--------- each phase unlocks 1-2 augmentations to the boss' attacks
--------- each phase reduces the cooldowns of the boss' skills (resulting in higher aggression)
