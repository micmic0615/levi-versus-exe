UPCOMING CHANGES:

--- Reworked Frenzy
------ Instead of triggering Frenzy (+100% atk speed bonus) for 1.5 seconds on kill and 0.5 seconds whenever hitting a staggered enemy, Frenzy is now triggered for 3 seconds whenever getting a tachyon.

--- Adjusted Beatdown damage to scale from both Vit and Shield damage
------ It used to scale 100% from vit damage, now it scales 80% from vit damage and 20% from shield damage

--- A variation of Beatdown now triggers whenever the player uses a spell (any skill that costs mana)
------ This beatdown automatically selects all currently staggered enemies and fires a cluster of bullets to them
------ The damage of these bullets scale 20% from vit damage and 80% from shield damage
------ This new mechanic, along with the adjustments to frenzy, are attempts to make Electron builds viable

--- Adjustments on weapon/spell damages and attribute scalings
--- Adjustments on enemy scaling

--- New Boss enemy in development
