changelog - Jan 15, 2020

--- Fixed Critical Bug where the game will sometimes crash when killing pinyatas
--- Minor tweaks/improvements to placeholder UIs/tooltips for better player comprehension
--- Fixed bug where enemy level modifier for BEEFY and PINYATA stacks multiplicatively, causing enormous enemy level boost
--- Adjusted all gold costs (arena rewards and shops).  Gold cost now scales diminishingly with your level (higher level gold costs won't be as expensive as before)
--- Minor tweaks to weapons/spells, particularly to weapons that apply the STUN debuff

--- Reworked STUN mechanic (STUN is the freeze mechanic applied by FLASH/BLINK/etc that doesn't require the player to reduce the enemy shield to zero)
------ Stunned enemies now wake up if they take damage after a 0.5 seconds buffer duration
------ Enemies that have "waken up" prematurely due to being damaged are slowed for the remaining stun duration
------ Increased stun durations across the board

--- Boss phase up animations now do not grant invulnerability (grants 90% vit resistance and 95% shield resistance instead)
--- Bosses are now uninterruptible when performing attacks/animations except by hard STUNS (FLASH/CULL) and STAGGER
