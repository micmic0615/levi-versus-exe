changelog - september 3, 2019

--- Added 3 new enemy types
------ Seeker: Butterfly enemy that fires homing bullets
------ Chaser: Lightning enchanted enemy that chases the player (upon contact, the player is shocked and slowed)
------ Ninja: Enemy that teleports to the player and cloaks itself before attacking

--- Expanded level count from 4 -> 8
------ Last level is just a 1 wave arena that contains a beefy version of all enemies because it is just a placeholder for a bossfight
